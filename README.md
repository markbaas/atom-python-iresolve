# Atom Python Iresolve

Uses [iresolve](https://github.com/markbaas/python-iresolve) to find unresolved imports and suggests modules from which they can be imported.


### Install

Make sure to have [iresolve](https://github.com/markbaas/python-iresolve) installed. Install it by running `pip install iresolve`

This packages works great with
* [python-isort](https://atom.io/packages/python-isort) to reorder imports and
* [linter-flake8](https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8) or [linter-pyflakes](https://atom.io/packages/linter-pyflakes) for error highlighting in editor.
